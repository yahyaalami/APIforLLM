# 🚀 Building a Python API with OpenAI Integration

##  🧰 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8+
pip (Python package installer)
OpenAI API Key: Obtain from OpenAI's platform

## 📁 Project Setup
### Create a Project Directory
bash :
mkdir openai_fastapi_project
cd openai_fastapi_project

 ### Initialize a Virtual Environment
 bash :
 python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### Install Required Packages
bash : 
pip install openai fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv

### Create a .env File for Environment Variables
In the project root, create a .env file: 
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

## 📝 Building the FastAPI Application
### Create main.py 

### Run the FastAPI Server
uvicorn main:app --reload

The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## 🧪 Testing the API
You can test the API using tools like Postman or curl. Here's how to test using curl:
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Once upon a time, in a land far away,", "max_tokens": 50, "temperature": 0.7}'


Expected Response:
{
  "response": " there lived a wise old owl who watched over the forest and its inhabitants..."
}


## 🛠️ Customizing the API
You can enhance the API by:
Adding Authentication: Implement API key verification for added security.
Logging: Integrate logging to monitor requests and responses.
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.
Frontend Integration: Connect the API to a frontend application using frameworks like React or Vue.js.
